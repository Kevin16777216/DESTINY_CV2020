# DESTINY_CV2020
Computer Vision testing for the 2020 FIRST Robotics Competition.
A .dll file for the OpenCV library needs to be downloaded off of https://opencv.org/releases/. This is done by selecting a version (WPILib comes with 347 built in but 420 is the most recent) and downloading via 'Windows.' The .dll is located in buiold/java/x64 or x86 for 32 bit systems. The .dll needs to be copied into one of the java.library.path folders. These can be found with: System.out.println(System.getProperty("java.library.path"));
